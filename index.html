        <b>Using other people's code</b>
      </div>
      <p>We can use other people's code to effectively save time
      and effort, which will let us add powerful functionality
      to our code.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-1">
        <b>Use functions</b>
      </div>
      <p>We can start by thinking about what we want our program to. For example, in this case we want our program to run and after 2 hours the program will run a video to have the user take a break. To simplify this we can break this into two steps. 1. wait 2 hours. 2. Open browser. To do this we can create a program that opens a web browser using the <span class="code">webbrowser.open</span> and <span class="code">time.sleep</span> functions to do what we want to do.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-2">
        <b>Using classes</b>
      </div>
      <p>When we use a class like <span class="code">turtle.Turtle()</span> we call the function <span class="code">__init__</span> that initializes some space for the instance a new instance.
      </p>
      <p>So for the send text mini-project we had to use the Twilio package to write a program to send ourselves a text message. In this mini-project we have to import a folder from inside the folder Twilio called <span class="code"> Twilio.rest</span> to import the class <span class="code">TwilioRestClient</span> and we use this class in our code.
      </p>
      <p>Classes are like a blue print so from the blue print we can create different objects or instances from that blue print.
      </p>
      <p>We know that the Python Standard library comes with different modules or folder like webbrowser, turtle, and time. When we want to use one of these modules we have to import it so that python can know that we are going to call functions or classes from those modules.
      </p>
      <p>Some functions like <span class="code">open</span> are built in so we don't have to import anything because it is readily availible because it is used very often.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-3">
        <b>Making classes</b>
      </div>
      <p>So we can make a class by bringing the function <span class="code">__init__</span> and listing what we want our class to capture. In this case we create a class <em>Movie</em> and we want it to remember: <em>title, storyline, poster_image, and trailer_youtube</em>. So we create this class which functions as a blue print and we cant make different instances of this class like we want one of toy story and avatar. They both use the same class.
      </p>
      <p>When we made the class Movie we made some <em>variables</em> instance variables to be exact so when we called the class <b>Movie</b> we need to give some variable like the title, story line, poster image, and trailer. These variables are associated with every instance we create from the class Movie.
      </p>
      <p>Inheritance is a way we can reuse code which is huge and is a big help when programming. It's easier to understand. For example we can create a class called Video's which will be the parent class then we cant have to child classes like the class movies that we have already written and the create a new class Tv-Shows. They will inhereit the things they have in common with the parent like title and run time.
      </p>
      <p>Method is a function which is a member of a class. For example <span class="code">show_info</span> in the Parent class is a method. We can reuse this method in in the child class even though this function is not explicitly defined in the child class we can still use the function because we inherit it from the parent class.
